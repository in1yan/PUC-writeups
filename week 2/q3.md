## Question 1

Question text

An operator is a special symbol used to manipulate data. The data items that the operators act upon are called operands.

The operator that works on a single operand is called a unary operator and that which works on two operands is known as a binary operator.

C provides many types of operators. They are: Arithmetic, Unary, Relational and equality, Logical, Assignment, Conditional, Bitwise and Special operators.

In C, we have 5 arithmetic operators:
Operator	Description
+	Used for addition
-	Used for subtraction
*	Used for multiplication
/	Used for division
%	Remainder/Modulus operator for finding remainder
Arithmetic operators are applied on numeric operands. Thus the operands can be integers, floats or characters (Since a character is internally represented by its numeric code).

The remainder operator (%) requires that both the operands be integers and the second operand be non-zero. Similarly the division operator (/) requires that the second operand be non-zero.

The format for usage of arithmetic operator is as follows:

operand1operatoroperand2

According to the coding conventions in C, a single space should be provided to the left and to the right of an operator.

The table given below demonstrates the use of various arithmetic operators using two variables num1 and num2 of type int with values 10 and 3 respectively:
Expression	Result
num1 + num2	13
num1 - num2	7
num1 * num2	30
num1 / num2	3
num1 % num2	1
Read the code given below to understand the usage of arithmetic operators. Retype in the space provided.

#include <stdio.h>

int main() 

{

    int num1 = 10, num2 = 3;

    printf("Addition Result = %d\n", (num1 + num2));

    printf("Subtraction Result = %d\n", (num1 - num2));

    printf("Multiplication Result = %d\n", (num1 * num2));

    printf("Division Result = %d\n", (num1 / num2));

    printf("Remainder = %d", (num1 % num2));

    return 0;

}
Answer:(penalty regime: 0 %)

### solution 

```c
# include <stdio.h>
int main(){
    int num1=10, num2=3;
    printf("Addition Result = %d\n", num1+num2);
    printf("Subtraction Result = %d\n", num1-num2);
    printf("Multiplication Result = %d\n", num1*num2);
    printf("Division Result = %d\n", num1/num2);
    printf("Remainder = %d", num1%num2);
}
```

## Question 2

Question text

Division of one integer by another integer is referred to as integer division. This operation always results in an integer with truncated quotient.

If a division operation is carried out with two floating point numbers or with one floating point number and one integer, the result will be a floating point quotient.

The table given below demonstrates the usage of various arithmetic operators using two variables num1 and num2 of type float with values 12.5 and 2.0 respectively:
Expression	Result
num1 + num2	14.500000
num1 - num2	10.500000
num1 * num2	25.000000
num1 / num2	6.250000
Note that the remainder operator (%) is not applicable for floating point numbers.

In the program given below, type the missing code to find the result of applying different arithmetic operators on floating point numbers.

Answer:(penalty regime: 0 %)

### solution 

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() 
{
    float num1 = 12.5, num2 = 2.0;
    printf("Result of addition = %f\n", (num1 + num2));
    printf("Result of subtraction = %f\n", (num1 - num2));
    printf("Result of multiplication = %f\n", (num1 * num2));
    printf("Result of division = %f\n", (num1 / num2));
    return 0;
}
```

## Question 3

Question text

The table given below demonstrates the use of various arithmetic operators using two variables c1 and c2 of type char with values 'A' and 'D' respectively:
Expression	Result
c1	65
c1 + c2	133
c1 + c2 + 5	138
c1 + c2 + '5'	186
In the above examples, the character 'A' is substituted with its ASCII value 65 and 'D' is substituted with 68.
The character '5' is substituted with its ASCII value 53. The integer value 5 is used as it is.

The following table demonstrates the usage of various arithmetic operators using two variables a and b of type int with values 11 and -3 respectively:
Expression	Result
a + b	8
a - b	14
a * b	-33
a / b	-3
a % b	2
In the program given below, type the missing code to find the result of applying different arithmetic operators on char data type values.

Answer:(penalty regime: 0 %)

### solution
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() 
{
    char c1 = 'A', c2 = 'D';
    printf("c1 = %d\n", c1);
    printf("c1 + c2 = %d\n", (c1 + c2));
    printf("c1 + c2 + 5 = %d\n", (c1 + c2 + 5));
    printf("Result = %d", (c1 + c2 + '5'));
    return 0;
}
```
